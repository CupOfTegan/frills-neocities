                    <p>The idea behind CSS Naked Day is to promote web standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of HTML, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good old play on words. In the words of 2006, itâ€™s time to show off your &lt;body&gt; for what it really is.</p>
