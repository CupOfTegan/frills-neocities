## Things I've been doing

<div class="pb-2">
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "🚣 Kayak training with the dog.",
      body = "It was in the shallows but the water was rapid so I was nervous we were going to float away! The dog did amazing though, I thought she would be spooked because she is terrible in the car, and this is also a vehicle that moves, but she was excited and handled the kayak moving really well. Lots of treats were had. Next time we'll go on deeper but calmer waters."
    ) }}
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "🎨️ Finished painting the garden fence.",
      body = "Just the gate fence to go now. The weather has really been in my favour and I need to hurry up to finish it because the rain will surely come back soon!"
    ) }}
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "👩‍💻 Giving eleventy a go.",
      body = " I have a github repo where it is very much the basic fork but it's progress. I've dabbled with Hugo in the past but the language and structure of 11ty (nunjucks) seems to make sense to me."
    ) }}
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "🌕 Moon sea dip.",
      body = "I haven't sea dipped for about 8 months, since before the clocks went back for winter. Completely forgot about the happy chemicals it makes. I was buzzing after and slept very very well."
    ) }}
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "✅ Completed a follow up survey with the ONS.",
      body = "Our answers had mostly not changed from March. But I found it really tough as someone with auditory processing difficulties, the bad phone line and the lady with the strong Spanish accent made my brain go ouch."
    ) }}
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "🕸️ Watched Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in the cinema.",
      body = "Adore the art styles. Big old set up for Spider-Verse 3. Threw a lot of popcorn at my face. 10/10."
    ) }}
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "🌊️ Sunrise sea dip.",
      body = "Got up at 4am to dip in the sea for sunrise. Sea was so far out I nearly lost my crocs in the mud a few times on the wade in. The north easterly wind is brutal, and I ended up getting chill from being exposed for too long, had to wrap up in my oodie and a scarf for a few hours."
    ) }}
    {{ macro.details(
      summary = "⛈️ Paddled in a waterfall pool in the shadow of a thunderstorm.",
      body = "Atmospheric, hot, a little bit scary, wholesome. The dog finally learnt to swim as well!"
    ) }}

## Things I haven't been doing

{{ macro.details(
    summary = "Keeping the house tidy.",
    body = "This has very much fallen by the wayside. I got into a bad mental health patch and it always reflects in my home, but now it's a little too overwhelming to sort."
) }}

{{ macro.details(
    summary = "💬 toki pona.",
    body = "I got all excited about it. and was enamoured by it's simplicity, but the practicality of it being used for anything or with anyone made me feel like I was wasting time when I could be learning a more relevant language to me, like Welsh."
) }}
