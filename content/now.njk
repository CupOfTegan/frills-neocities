  <h2>Months</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading the Throne of Glass series and enjoying it. I had been in a reading dry spell for 2Â½ years, so I am really savouring it at the moment. I have a large TBR list now.</li>
    <li>Lots of accessibility assessments for work. There has a been a fresh flurry of clients requesting them, I think as part of the UK gov carrying out more monitoring reports.</li>
    <li>Maintaining the health of pup dog (suffered from an acute kidney injury in September 2023). Blood tests (to monitor her creatinine and urea levels) are now once every six months.</li>
