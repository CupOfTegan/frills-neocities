## üê∂ Orla monitoring
Spent a lot of time monitoring the pup, had a couple of follow-up blood tests, all of which are looking good. She is totally back to herself now, which is the biggest marker for things being OK. We certainly dodged a bullet. This month, I also took some time to make a [shrine to her on Neocities](/shrine/orla).

## üéÇ Birthdays
Had several birthday celebrations this month. All with cake and merriment. My dad, my fiance's nan, and one of my good friends all turned a year older.

## üçÇ Made autumn wreaths at work
Part of my work's culture club activities was a group session making autumn wreaths. I used dried hydrangeas, craspedia, bunny's tail grass and eucalyptus to create mine. I've hung it indoors so it will last longer than being on the front door. Such seasonal vibes!

## 8 year anniversary with my boo
We aren't very good at celebrating and it fell inside a very very busy week, but we hung out, did a sunrise sea dip together to mark it.

## Walking Murphy
Helping out my fiance's mum, who had knee surgery this month. We took her pup Murphy for a few evening walks whilst she was recovering.

## Dog sat Effie
Love looking after the Spanador, Effie, Orla's bestie.

## Work anniversary
It's been 4 years at my current place of work. A good time to take stock and see how far I've come. I wrote an article on [my developer story](/blog/231021-my-developer-story.md) and decided to...

## Became a Neocities supporter
Which also gives me access to a custom domain and all file types!

## Walk in the woods
On a free (original plans fell through) weekend, we took the car out to a local woodland I hadn't been before. It was gorgeous, quite, and earthy. The trees we're quite as old and the canopy was not as thick, but it reminded me of the forests in Vancouver from our trip in April 2023.

## Rescheduled sister visit

## Halloween event at work
