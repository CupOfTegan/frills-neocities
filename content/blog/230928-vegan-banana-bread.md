A delicious vegan recipe that an old friend imparted with me before we moved away, handwritten inside a greetings card with a penguin on it.

## Ingredients

- 3 to 4 ripe bananas
- 70 grams of sugar (white, brown or a mix - I prefer brown as it gives it more flavour)
- 100 grams of bland oil (I use vegetable oil, but the recipe recommends rapeseed)
-  250 grams of self raising flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

## Variants
- Poppy seeds
- Cocoa nibs
- Chopped nuts
- Chopped chocolate
- Nutella

## Instructions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 220*c (Gas Mark 7)
1. Mash the bananas then add the sugar & oil.
1. Into this beat the flour & baking powder
1. You then add your chosen variants, whatever you fancy!
1. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, then cover with foil and continue to bake for another 25 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.

In the words of my friend:
Now nom it up :)
