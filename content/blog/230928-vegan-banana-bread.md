A delicious vegan recipe that an old friend imparted with me before we moved away, handwritten inside a greetings card with a penguin on it.

‚è∞ Total cooking time: 45 minutes

ü•£ Tools: Mixing bowl, wooden spoon, bread tin, foil.

## Ingredients

- 1 tea spoon baking powder

## Variants
- Chopped chocolate
- Nutella
- Walnuts
- Poppy seeds
