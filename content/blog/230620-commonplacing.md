I've been learning about the concept of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), a notebook that is for raw ideas, collections of quotes, notes on a topic that you're looking into. They don't need to be connected, or themed. Some people organis them, but I like the idea of it being a space that doesn't need a theme.

I know this is how some people already use notebooks, my partner for one, but I am the sort of person that will theme a notebook to a particular thing, say it's drawings, or lists, or a particular RPG I am playing. I then lose interest or stop doing that thing, or lose the book for a bit, and then come up with a new theme for a notebook and rip everything out so I can start from fresh. I have had a lot of skinny notebooks in my lifetime.

The analogue-ness of pen to paper also draws me in. While I appreciate my phone and it's capabilities a lot, it is very proficient and sucking me down a rabbit hole of weird TikTok lives, usually at night time before I go to sleep. I doubt I could ever replace my phone or a digital calendar with an analogue one (the ability to set repeating events is lifesaving), but to do lists and notetaking on my digital devices have never stuck because they don't give the same dopamine hit as pen to paper does.
