Matthew was a slim lad. He ate and ate but never put on weight.
One day we was walking down the cobbled highstreet of his hometown,
a route he had taken countless times before, when he noticed a crack between the bakery and the newspaper shop.

He only spotted it because there was a bright light gleaming through from the otherside, illuminating the gap.

There was noone around on the highstreet this early in the morning, the bakery wasn't open yet but the smell the fresh pastries was wafting from the vents. Matthew picked at the crack in the bricks, mortar crumbling quietly onto the cobble below, and peeked with his beady eyes through the fracture.
