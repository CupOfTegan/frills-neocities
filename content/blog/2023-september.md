## 🧗🏻‍♀️ Went bouldering for the first time
Easier and harder than I thought it would be! My hands were sore afterwards, but that dopamine hit when you got to the top of one of the (admittedy totally beginner, VB) routes felt goooood.

## 🏖 Took the dog and her bestie to the beach
Ahead of her spay, we took Orla and her pal Effie to the seaside to run around, paddling in the sea and catch their balls.

## 🎭 Watched Pride & Prejudice outdoor theatre
The sun was out, the SPF was applied (multiple times), we had cream tea and watched P&P being performed by 5 people - so clever!!

## 🎲 Dinner & games night with friends
Delicious [vegan thai green curry](https://web.archive.org/web/20230531093326/https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-thai-green-curry/), bakery goods for pudding. Notable games that we played:
