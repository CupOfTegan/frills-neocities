## 

Over the next few weeks I would like to start focusing on my physical and mental health some more. I've had a few bad months for my mental health, with it escalating slightly since Orla was seriously unwell 3 weeks ago, and consequently my physical health.

If I were a Sim, my plumbob would be a orange to red. Looking to my motive metres, they all need a bit of work.

### Hunger
### Comfort
### Bladder
### Energy
### Fun
### Social
### Hygiene
### Environment
Perhaps my most important metre, and the one I struggle with the most. In a home of neaurodivergents, we struggle to keep on to of keeping house. We have too much stuff from all our different hobbies and things we never finished. Those collect dust and dog hair and become such an overwhelming task, even if you manage to clean one room, it feels like a drop in the ocean with what is left to do.

No such thing as later.

Being in a calorie deficit, tracking calories and putting in place a daily protein goal to hit.
A daily step count and a water goal.
