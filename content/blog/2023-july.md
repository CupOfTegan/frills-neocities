Spent time with friends and family this month, saw lots of friends - some that I hadn't seen in at least 12 months!

Done a few tweaks to the site, added a button wall and made my own button. Really need to write my manifesto so that I can align myself with it, mostly around my rules for using images (trying to avoid images entirely because of their file size). Already considering a redesign, but need way more content here first.
