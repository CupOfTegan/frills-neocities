title: About
description: There is a rustling noise from behind a bush and you go to investigate. Amidst the leaves, a pair of mischievous brown eyes meet yours. Slowly, a woman emerges from the undergrowth, adorned with tangled brown and blonde hair and grubby gardening attire. You get a waft of earth and soap as she extends her hand in greeting.

		<p><span class="emoji" role="img" aria-label="Wave">üëã</span> Hey! I'm a 30ish y/o frontend dev based in Wales, UK. My pronouns are she/her.</p>

		<h2>Some things about me</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>üê∂ I have an adorable canine companion, Orla! She's a lovely champagne (pale yellow) working Labrador, she has so many beans. She's the happiest pup when she's with one of her top 10 favorite humans, exploring the great outdoors, or frolicking in tall grass!</li>
			<li>üè† I am incredibly lucky to be a homeowner, and have my own garden where I grow vegetables and (mostly inherited) roses.</li>
			<li>üéÆ Ah, gaming! I've found my heart in cozy and heartwarming games on my trusty Steam Deck. Titles like Stardew Valley, It Takes Two, and Garden Galaxy have become my new go-tos. I bid farewell to a decade-long love affair with first-person-shooter games (<a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-gb/career/Frills-2772/" target="_blank">Mercy main in Overwatch</a> and Killjoy main in Valorant) in December 2022.
			<li>ü•∞ My absolute, all-time favorite game? It has to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600990/The_Gardens_Between/" target="_blank">The Gardens Between</a>, a nostalgic game about friendship and growing up, created in a beautiful art style and with a very fun timey-wimey mechanic.</
			li>
			<li>ü•ï I have been vegetarian since July 2020, a long term dream enabled by the break in social norms during Lockdown.</li>
